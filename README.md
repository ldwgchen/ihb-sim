# ihb-sim
Inhibition Simulator is a toy GUI app intended to be used to create demonstrations of the neural wiring of the sensory system.

"poetry.lock" and "pyprojects.toml" are elements of the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) dependency management system. This app requires [kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) to work. You can `poetry install` to install kivy.

After setting up the correct environment, simply run "source/vis.py" to start the application.

ARCHIVED because this was written badly.
